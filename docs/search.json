Imputation methods. look closely two elements framework. first imputation method vector. “polyreg” imputation method (polytomous logistic regression) appropriate data, like , comprising unordered categorical variables. Variable proxy imputed using polyreg method; variables, predictors, imputed, thus methods empty. method correctly assigned, assign follows, Predictor matrix. second element review predictor matrix. row label identifies variable predicted; columns indicate predictor variables. However, variables assigned method imputed. case, variable imputed proxy, row matrix gets used last row. zeros ones tell us proxy going predicted institution, race, sex. default setting incorrect, can set manually. , note bottom row row need proxy variable imputed.","code":"# Imputation framework framework <- mice(fye, maxit = 0)  # Display the results framework #> Class: mids #> Number of multiple imputations:  5  #> Imputation methods: #>        mcid        race         sex institution       proxy  #>          \"\"          \"\"          \"\"          \"\"   \"polyreg\"  #> PredictorMatrix: #>             mcid race sex institution proxy #> mcid           0    1   1           1     1 #> race           0    0   1           1     1 #> sex            0    1   0           1     1 #> institution    0    1   1           0     1 #> proxy          0    1   1           1     0 #> Number of logged events:  1  #>   it im dep     meth  out #> 1  0  0     constant mcid # Imputation method method_vector <- framework[[\"method\"]]  # Display the results method_vector #>        mcid        race         sex institution       proxy  #>          \"\"          \"\"          \"\"          \"\"   \"polyreg\" # Manually assign the variable(s) being imputed method_vector[c(\"proxy\")] <- \"polyreg\"  # Manually assign the variable(s) not being imputed method_vector[c(\"mcid\", \"institution\", \"race\", \"sex\")] <- \"\"  # Display the results method_vector #>        mcid        race         sex institution       proxy  #>          \"\"          \"\"          \"\"          \"\"   \"polyreg\" # Imputation predictor matrix predictor_matrix <- framework[[\"predictorMatrix\"]]  # Display the results predictor_matrix #>             mcid race sex institution proxy #> mcid           0    1   1           1     1 #> race           0    0   1           1     1 #> sex            0    1   0           1     1 #> institution    0    1   1           0     1 #> proxy          0    1   1           1     0 # Predictor row for this example predictor_matrix[\"proxy\", ] #>        mcid        race         sex institution       proxy  #>           0           1           1           1           0 # Manually assign zero columns predictor_matrix[, c(\"mcid\", \"proxy\")] <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)  # Manually assign predictor columns predictor_matrix[, c(\"institution\", \"race\", \"sex\")] <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)  # Display the result predictor_matrix #>             mcid race sex institution proxy #> mcid           0    0   0           0     0 #> race           0    0   0           0     0 #> sex            0    0   0           0     0 #> institution    0    0   0           0     0 #> proxy          0    1   1           1     0"},{"path":"https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-070-creating-fye-proxies.html","id":"optional-predictors","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Optional predictors","title":"Creating FYE proxies","text":"default predictors set prep_fye_mice() institution (required), race/ethnicity, sex. acceptable, can skip next section, Imputing missing values.
