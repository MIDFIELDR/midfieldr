midfieldr is a package for investigating student record data provided by registrars at US universities participating in the MIDFIELD project. 

A stratified sample of the MIDFIELD database is accessible using midfieldr. The sample comprises demographic, term, course, and degree information for `r data_bits[["obs_student"]]` undergraduate students from `r data_bits[["year_min"]]` to `r data_bits[["year_max"]]`. Because of their size, the sample datasets are provided in separate data packages.

midfieldr includes functions for selecting specific fields of study and  aggregating, computing, and graphing student persistence metrics.

## Installation

midfieldr is not currently available from CRAN, but the development version can be installed from github with:

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr")

## Usage

The basic units for computing persistence metrics are the individual student, course, term, program, or institution. 

For investigating graduation rates

- `gather_start()` 
- `gather_grad()` 
- `tally_gradrate()` 
- `graph_gradrate()` 

For investigating stickiness 

- `gather_ever()`
- `gather_grad()` 
- `tally_stickiness()` 
- `graph_stickiness()`  


## Data 

The sample of the MIDFIELD database that is accessible using midfieldr and its data packages includes:   

- `cip` in the midfieldr package. A tidy data frame with `r data_bits[["obs_cip"]]` observations and `r data_bits[["var_cip"]]` CIP variables of program codes and names at the 2, 4, and 6-digit levels. Each observation is a unique program. This dataset occupies `r round(data_bits[["size_cip"]] / 1e+3, 0)` kb of memory.  

- `midfieldstudents` in the [midfieldstudents](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfieldstudents) package. A tidy data frame with `r data_bits[["obs_student"]]` observations and `r data_bits[["var_student"]]` demographic variables. Each observation is a unique student. This dataset occupies `r round(data_bits[["size_student"]] / 1e+6, 1)` Mb of memory.  

- `midfieldcourses` in the [midfieldcourses](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfieldcourses) package. A tidy data frame with `r round(data_bits[["obs_course"]] / 1e+6, 1)` M observations and `r data_bits[["var_course"]]` academic course variables. Each observation is one course in one term for one student. This dataset occupies `r round(data_bits[["size_course"]] / 1e+6, 1)` Mb of memory. 

- `midfieldterms` in the [midfieldterms](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfieldterms) package. A tidy data frame with `r round(data_bits[["obs_term"]] / 1e+0, 1)` observations and `r data_bits[["var_term"]]` academic term variables. Each observation is one term for one student. This dataset occupies `r round(data_bits[["size_term"]] / 1e+6, 1)` Mb of memory. 

- `midfielddegrees` in the [midfielddegrees](https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfielddegrees) package. A tidy data frame with `r data_bits[["obs_degree"]]` observations and `r data_bits[["var_degree"]]` graduation variables. Each observation is a unique student. This dataset occupies `r round(data_bits[["size_degree"]] / 1e+6, 1)` Mb of memory.
