The goal of midfieldr is to provide tools and guides for working with longitudinal data from the MIDFIELD database.  




## Overview 

[**MIDFIELD**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD){target="_blank"} contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7M students at 21 US institutions (as of June 2022). MIDFIELD is large enough to permit grouping and summarizing by multiple characteristics, enabling researchers to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, prior achievement) and curricular pathways (including coursework and major) by institution and over time. 

**midfieldr** is an R package that provides tools for working with MIDFIELD SURs. The tools in midfieldr work with the research data in the MIDFIELD database and with the practice data in the midfielddata package.  

[**midfielddata**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/){target="_blank"} is an R package that provides practice data (a proportionate stratified sample of  MIDFIELD) with longitudinal SURs for nearly 98,000 undergraduates at 12 institutions from 1987–2016 organized in four data tables: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
wrapr::build_frame(
  "Data set", "Each row is", "N rows", "N columns" |
    "student", "a student upon being admitted", "98k", "13" |
    "course", "a student in a course", "3.4M", "12" |
    "term", "a student in a term", "711k", "13" |
    "degree", "a student who completes their program", "48k", "5"
) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "llrr") |>
  kableExtra::kable_paper(lightable_options = "basic", full_width = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "#c7eae5") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, monospace = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:4, color = "black", background = "white")
```


All four data tables are keyed by student ID. Tables `student` and `degree` have one observation (row) per student. Tables `course` and `term` have multiple observations per student because students can be enrolled in more than one course in a term and more than one term over their program. 




## Usage

The outline of our typical workflow is: 

- Define the study parameters
- Transform the data to yield the observations of interest
- Calculate summary statistics and metrics
- Create tables and charts to display results
- Iterate

In this brief usage example, the goal is to tabulate counts of engineering students by race/ethnicity, sex, and graduation status. Data processing is performed using data.table syntax. From the midfielddata package, we use data sets `student`, `term`, and `degree`. From the midfieldr package, we use the functions: 

- `add_timely_term()`
- `add_data_sufficiency()`
- `add_completion_status()`


```{r}
# Packages used
library("midfieldr")
library("midfielddata")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("data.table"))

# Load the midfielddata practice data used here
data(student, term, degree)

# Initialize the working data table
DT <- copy(term)

# Timely completion term required for data sufficiency
DT <- add_timely_term(DT, term)

# Filter for data sufficiency
DT <- add_data_sufficiency(DT, term)
DT <- DT[data_sufficiency == "include"]

# Filter observations for degree-seeking using an inner join
DT <- DT[student, .(mcid, cip6, timely_term), on = c("mcid"), nomatch = NULL]

# Filter observations for engineering programs
DT <- DT[cip6 %like% "^14"]

# Filter observations for unique students (first instance)
DT <- DT[, .SD[1], by = c("mcid")]

# Add completion status
DT <- add_completion_status(DT, degree)

# Add race and sex using a left outer join
DT <- student[DT, .(completion_status, sex, race), on = c("mcid")]

# Calculate summary statistics
DT <- DT[, .N, by = c("completion_status", "sex", "race")]

# Tabulate results
DT[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]
DT_display <- dcast(DT, race_sex ~ completion_status, value.var = "N")
setcolorder(DT_display, c("race_sex", "timely", "untimely"))
setnames(DT_display,
  old = c("race_sex", "timely", "untimely", "NA"),
  new = c("Group", "Timely completion", "Untimely completion", "Did not complete")
)
```

Tabulated results of usage example. "Timely completion" is the count of graduates completing their programs in no more than 6 years; "Untimely completion" is the count of those graduating in more than 6 years; "Did not complete" is the count of non-graduates. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT_display |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "lrrr") |>
  kableExtra::kable_paper(lightable_options = "basic", full_width = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "#c7eae5") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:3, color = "black", background = "white")
```

## Install midfieldr {#install-midfieldr}

midfieldr is not yet available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). To install the development version of midfieldr from its `drat` repository, type in the Console: 

``` r
# install midfieldr from drat repo
install.packages("midfieldr", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source", 
                 dependencies = "Imports")
```

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
library("midfieldr")
help("midfieldr-package")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-1.png")
```






## Install midfielddata {#install-midfielddata}

Because of its size, installing the practice data takes time; please be patient and wait for the prompt “>” to reappear. In the Console, run:

``` r
# install midfielddata  
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
# be patient
``` 

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
