## Introduction

```{r child = "man/rmd/note-description-paragraph.Rmd"}
```

midfieldr provides these functions for manipulating student-level data: 

- `add_completion_status()` Determine completion status for every student
- `add_data_sufficiency()` Determine data sufficiency for every student
- `add_timely_term()` Calculate a timely completion term for every student
- `filter_cip()` Filter CIP data to match search strings
- `prep_fye_mice()` Prepare FYE data for multiple imputation
- `select_required()` Select required midfieldr variables

Additional functions for processing intermediate results: 

- `order_multiway()` Order categorical variables of multiway data

R packages in examples and vignettes

- *Data preparation.* &nbsp; We use the data.table system and some base R for data manipulation [@Dowle+Srinivasan:2022:data.table]. To assist users who might prefer other systems, the MIDFIELD Institute website [@midfieldinstitute:2024] includes tutorials providing side-by-side base R, data.table, and dplyr solutions to common data shaping tasks using MIDFIELD practice data.  
- *Charts.* &nbsp; Our preferred package for charts is ggplot2 [@Wickham:2016:ggplot2]. The lattice package [@Sarkar:2008] also offers users comprehensive control over graphical elements (though our lattice experience is no longer current).  









## Usage

In this example, we gather all students ever enrolled in Engineering and summarize their graduation status (in any major), grouping by race/ethnicity and sex. If you are writing your own script to follow along, we use these packages in this example:

```{r}
library(midfieldr)
library(midfielddata)
library(data.table)
```

Load the practice data. Reduce initial dimensions of data tables. 

```{r}
# Load the practice data
data(student, term, degree)

# Reduce dimensions of source data tables
student <- select_required(student)
term <- select_required(term)
degree <- select_required(degree)

# View example result
term
```

Filter for data sufficiency. 

```{r}
# Initialize the working data frame
DT <- term[, .(mcid, cip6)]

# Filter observations for data sufficiency
DT <- add_timely_term(DT, term)
DT <- add_data_sufficiency(DT, term)
DT <- DT[data_sufficiency == "include"]
DT
```

Filter for degree-seeking students ever enrolled in Engineering. 

```{r}
# Inner join to filter observations for degree-seeking
cols_we_want <- student[, .(mcid)]
DT <- cols_we_want[DT, on = c("mcid"), nomatch = NULL]

# Filter observations for engineering programs
DT <- DT[cip6 %like% "^14"]

# Filter observations for unique students (first instance)
DT <- DT[, .SD[1], by = c("mcid")]
DT
```

Determine completion status. 

```{r}
# Add completion status variable
DT <- add_completion_status(DT, degree)
DT
```

Aggregate observations by groupings.

```{r}
# Left join to add race/ethnicity and sex variables (omit unknowns)
cols_we_want <- student[, .(mcid, race, sex)]
DT <- student[DT, on = c("mcid")]
DT <- DT[!(race %ilike% "unknown" | sex %ilike% "unknown")]

# Create a variable combining race/ethnicity and sex
DT[, people := paste(race, sex)]

# Aggregate observations by groupings
DT_display <- DT[, .N, by = c("completion_status", "people")]
setorderv(DT_display, c("completion_status", "people"))
DT_display
```

Reshape and display results. 

```{r}
# Transform to row-record form
DT_display <- dcast(DT_display, people ~ completion_status, value.var = "N", fill = 0)

# Prepare the table for display
setcolorder(DT_display, c("people", "timely", "late"))
setkeyv(DT_display, c("people"))
setnames(DT_display,
  old = c("people", "timely", "late", "NA"),
  new = c("People", "Timely completion", "Late completion", "Did not complete")
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(gt)
DT_display |>
  gt() |>
  tab_caption("Table 1: Completion status of engineering undergraduates in the practice data")|> 
  tab_options(table.font.size = "small") |>
  opt_stylize(style = 1, color = "gray") |>
  tab_style(style = list(cell_fill(color = "#c7eae5")),
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()))
```

"Timely completion" is the count of graduates completing their programs in no more than 6 years; "Late completion" is the count of those graduating in more than 6 years; "Did not complete" is the count of non-graduates. 

```{r child = "man/rmd/note-for-practice-only-1.Rmd"}
```








## Installation

Install from CRAN with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("midfieldr")
```

Install latest development version from GitHub with: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr")
```

midfieldr interacts with practice data provided in the midfielddata data package. Install midfielddata from its  repository with:  

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("midfielddata",
  repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/",
  type = "source"
)
```

The installed size of midfielddata is about 24 Mb, so the installation takes some time.
