The goal of _midfieldr_ is to provide tools for working with MIDFIELD data, a  resource of longitudinal, de-identified, individual student unit records from multiple US institutions. 


## Background 

[MIDFIELD](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD) (as of May 2021) contains individual student unit record (SUR) data for 1.7M unique students at 33 US institutions. MIDFIELD is large enough to permit grouping and summarizing by multiple characteristics simultaneously, enabling researchers to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, prior achievement) and curricular pathways (including coursework and major) by institution and over time. 

A proportionate stratified sample of these data (for practice) is available in [_midfielddata_](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/), an R data package with longitudinal SURs for nearly 98,000 undergraduates at 12 institutions from  1987--2016 organized in four data tables: 

- [`student`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/student.html) 97,640 rows and 13 columns 
- [`course`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/course.html) 3.5M rows and 12 columns  
- [`term`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/term.html) 728,000 rows and 13 columns   
- [`degree`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/degree.html) 47,500 rows and 5 columns 

The tools in _midfieldr_ work equally well with the practice data in _midfielddata_ and the research data in MIDFIELD. 



## Usage

In this brief usage example, we compare counts of engineering students by race/ethnicity, sex, and graduation status. Data manipulation is performed using the _data.table_ package. 

``` r
# packages used 
library("midfieldr")
library("midfielddata")
library("data.table")

# Load the data tables
data(student, term, degree)

# Filter for engineering programs 
DT <- term[cip6 %like% "^14", .(mcid, institution, cip6)]
DT <- unique(DT)

# Ensure students are degree-seeking 
DT <- filter_match(DT, match_to = student, by_col = "mcid")

# Estimate timely completion terms 
DT <- add_timely_term(DT, midfield_term = term)

# Determine graduation status  
DT <- add_completion_timely(DT, midfield_degree = degree)
DT[, grad_status := fifelse(completion_timely, "grad", "non-grad")]

# Apply the data sufficiency criterion 
DT <- add_data_sufficiency(DT, midfield_term = term)
DT <- DT[data_sufficiency == TRUE]

# Obtain race/ethnicity and sex
DT <- add_race_sex(DT, midfield_student = student)

# Count by grouping variables
result <- DT[, .N, by = .(grad_status, sex, race)]
result[order(grad_status, sex, race)]
#>     grad_status    sex            race     N
#>          <char> <char>          <char> <int>
#>  1:        grad Female           Asian   182
#>  2:        grad Female           Black   433
#>  3:        grad Female Hispanic/Latinx    85
#>  4:        grad Female   International    30
#>  5:        grad Female Native American    14
#> ---                                         
#> 24:    non-grad   Male Hispanic/Latinx   176
#> 25:    non-grad   Male   International   157
#> 26:    non-grad   Male Native American    38
#> 27:    non-grad   Male   Other/Unknown   113
#> 28:    non-grad   Male           White  4423
```






## Requirements

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (>= 3.5.0)
- [_midfielddata_](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/) for practice working with student unit records. 
- [_data.table_](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) recommended for data manipulation, but not required.  
- [_ggplot2_](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) recommended for data graphics, but not required.




## Installation

To install the development version of _midfieldr_ from [GitHub](https://github.com/), type in the Console: 

``` r
# install remotes
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")

# install midfieldr
remotes::install_github("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr")
```

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
library("midfieldr")
help("midfieldr-package")
```

![](man/figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-1.png)

Because of its size, installing the practice data takes time; please be patient and wait for the prompt “>” to reappear. In the Console, run:

``` r
# install midfielddata  
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
# be patient
``` 

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
library("midfielddata")
help("midfielddata-package")
```
