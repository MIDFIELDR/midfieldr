## Undergoing major revision

Based on feedback from workshop attendees, the package is undergoing major revision to the vignettes and the underlying functionality. 

While in this ambiguous state, the package should be used experimentally only. We hope to have the update complete by the end of August 2020. 

## Tools for student records research

The *Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development* [(MIDFIELD)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD) is a partnership of US higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains registrar's data for 1.7M undergraduates in all majors at 19 institutions from 1987--2019. The data are organized in four related tables: students, courses, terms, and degrees. A MIDFIELD sample is provided in the midfielddata package.   

**midfielddata** [(link)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/) A  stratified sample of MIDFIELD data. Contains data for `r obs_students` undergraduates at `r n_inst` institutions from `r year_limits[1]`--`r year_limits[2]` in four data sets: `midfieldstudents`, `midfieldcourses`, `midfieldterms`, and `midfielddegrees`.  

**midfieldr**  Tools for studying student records from midfielddata or the larger MIDFIELD database. Enables research in the intersectionality of race/ethnicity, sex, and discipline with metrics such as stickiness (retention by a discipline), migrator graduation rate, and migration yield (attraction of a discipline).

For MIDFIELD partner researchers: In making the midfielddata package public, confidentiality required some MIDFIELD variables to be anonymized and others to be omitted. Thus the midfielddata data dictionary is a subset of the MIDFIELD data dictionary.

## Installation

Install midfielddata first. 

Because of its size, the data package is stored in a drat repository. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt ">" to reappear.

```r
# install midfielddata first 
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
```

To confirm a successful installation, run the following to view the package help page. 

```r
library(midfielddata)
? midfielddata
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.  

<img src="man/figures/README-midfielddata-help-page-2.png" alt="midfielddata help page" class="center" width="80%">

Once you have conformed that midfielddata is successfully installed, install midfieldr. The package is currently available from GitHub, but should be submitted to CRAN by September 2020.  

```r
# install from CRAN (not yet available)
# install.packages("midfieldr")

# or install the development version from GitHub (available now)
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr")
```

## Data

The midfieldr package includes: 

- `cip`  Data frame with `r obs_cip` observations and `r var_cip` CIP variables of program codes and names at the 2, 4, and 6-digit levels. Each observation is a unique program keyed by a 6-digit CIP code. Occupies `r size_cip` of memory.  Data dictionary [(link)](reference/cip.html). 

The midfielddata package contains four data sets that constitute a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD database. 

- `midfieldstudents` Data frame with `r obs_students` observations and `r var_students` demographic variables. Each observation is a unique student keyed by student ID. Occupies `r size_students` of memory. Data dictionary   [(link)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/midfieldstudents.html). 

- `midfieldcourses` Data frame with `r round(obs_courses/1e6, 1)` M observations and `r var_courses` academic course variables keyed by student ID, term, and course. Each observation is one course in one term for one student. Occupies `r size_courses` of memory. Data dictionary  [(link)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/midfieldcourses.html).

- `midfieldterms` Data frame with `r obs_terms` observations and `r var_terms` academic term variables keyed by student ID and term. Each observation is one term for one student. Occupies `r size_terms` of memory. Data dictionary  [(link)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/midfieldterms.html).

- `midfielddegrees` A data frame with `r obs_degrees` observations and `r var_degrees` graduation variables keyed by student ID. Each observation is a unique student. Occupies `r size_degrees` of memory. Data dictionary  [(link)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/midfielddegrees.html).

## Usage

**midfieldr functions** work with MIDFIELD-structured data to access and manipulate student records. A typical workflow might include:  

- `filter_text()` gather specific programs to study  
- `subset_feasible()` subset students for 6-year completion feasibility
- `prepare_multiway()` condition multiway data for graphing 

**R ecosystem**. midfieldr uses data.table functions and syntax. midfielddata data sets are class `data.table` and `data.frame`. However, midfieldr functions attempt to preserve data frame extensions assigned by the user (`tbl` for example). Thus users who prefer a different ecosystem such as dplyr should find that the package is compatible with their preference. 

In general the midfieldr vignettes use the following packages: 

- midfieldr 
- midfielddata 
- data.table [@Dowle+Srinivasan:2020:data.table]
- ggplot2 [@Wickham:2016:ggplot2]

**example**. The *Get started* vignette [(link)](articles/get_started.html) introduces some of the basic midfieldr functions and the midfielddata data sets. Additional vignettes develop the material in more detail.
