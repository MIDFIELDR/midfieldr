## Undergoing major revision

Based on feedback from workshop attendees and use-testing, the package is undergoing significant, non-backwards-compatible revision to th API. 

While in this ambiguous state, the package should be used experimentally only. We hope to have a stable release by the end of July 2021.  






## Tools for student records research

The *Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development* (MIDFIELD) is a partnership of US higher education institutions with engineering programs. MIDFIELD contains registrar's data for 1.7M undergraduates in all majors at 19 institutions from 1987--2019 [@Ohland+Long:2016].

Our software environment comprises two R packages:  

- **midfieldr** An R package providing functions specialized for manipulating MIDFIELD data to examine the intersectionality of race/ethnicity, sex, and discipline in persistence metrics such as stickiness (retention by a discipline) and graduation rate. 

- [**midfielddata**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/) An R  package with practice data for users to learn about student record analysis  using R. However, these data are not suitable for drawing inferences about student performance, i.e., not for research. 

## Data

**Taxonomy of programs**

midfieldr includes `cip`, a data frame of the 2010 *Classification of Instructional Programs* (CIP)---a taxonomy of academic programs curated by the US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). 

- `cip` [(Link to data dictionary)](reference/cip.html) Data frame with `r obs_cip` observations and `r var_cip` variables providing program codes and names at the 2, 4, and 6-digit levels. Each observation is a unique program keyed by a 6-digit CIP code. Occupies `r size_cip` of memory.  

**Student records for practice**

midfielddata provides a proportionate stratified random sample of the MIDFIELD research data. The sampling strata are institution, cip4 (the first four digits of the 6-digit CIP code), transfer status, race/ethnicity, and sex. Contains data for `r obs_students` undergraduates at `r n_inst` institutions from `r year_limits[1]`--`r year_limits[2]` in four data sets:

- `student` [(Link to data dictionary)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/student.html) Data frame with `r obs_students` observations and `r var_students` demographic variables. Each observation is a unique student keyed by student ID. Occupies `r size_students` of memory. 

- `course` [(Link to data dictionary)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/course.html) Data frame with `r round(obs_courses/1e6, 1)` M observations and `r var_courses` academic course variables keyed by student ID, term, and course. Each observation is one course in one term for one student. Occupies `r size_courses` of memory.

- `term` [(Link to data dictionary)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/term.html) Data frame with `r obs_terms` observations and `r var_terms` academic term variables keyed by student ID and term. Each observation is one term for one student. Occupies `r size_terms` of memory. 

- `degree` [(Link to data dictionary)](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/degree.html) A data frame with `r obs_degrees` observations and `r var_degrees` graduation variables keyed by student ID. Each observation is a unique student. Occupies `r size_degrees` of memory.

In making the midfielddata package public, maintaining confidentiality required that some variables be omitted and that student and institution identifiers be anonymized.

**Student records for research**

Complete MIDFIELD data suitable for student-records research are available to researchers under the following conditions:

- Your institutional IRB has granted approval for your project to study students using MIDFIELD. At most institutions, the use of MIDFIELD data for research is  in the IRB "Exempt" category, but institutional practices vary. 

- Each researcher using the data signs a letter of confidentiality describing  the guidelines for how the data may be reported.

The research data and practice data have the same structure (`student`, `course`, `term`, and `degree`) with the same variable names, though some research variables are omitted from the practice data, as noted above. Thus R scripts written for the practice data should generally work with the research data.  

For more information about obtaining access to MIDFIELD research data, contact Russell Long (ralong@purdue.edu)

## Install midfieldr

We use the `install_github()` function from the remotes package to install midfieldr from GitHub. In the Console, run:

```r
# install remotes
install.packages("remotes")

# install midfieldr
remotes::install_github("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr")
```

You can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:

```r
library("midfieldr")
? midfieldr
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. 

<img src="man/figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-2.png" alt="midfieldr help page" class="center" width="80%">

## Install the practice data

Because of its size, the data package is stored in a "drat" repository. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt ">" to reappear. In the Console, run: 

```r
# install midfielddata  
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
# be patient
```

Once the Console prompt ">" reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:

```r
library("midfielddata")
? midfielddata
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.  If this step is successful, you can go on to the next step.

## Usage

**midfieldr functions** work with MIDFIELD-structured data to access and manipulate student records. Usage examples are given in the vignettes, but an outline of a typical workflow might include these midfieldr functions: 

- `filter_search()` identify program names and codes
- `filter_match()` limit the study to degree-seeking students 
- `add_timely_term()` estimate the latest term for which program completion could be considered timely 
- `add_data_sufficiency()` determine if data have sufficient span to fairly assess a student's record 
- `add_completion_timely()` determine if a student completes their program in a timely manner 
- `add_race_sex()` obtain student demographics
- `condition_multiway()` condition multiway data for graphing 

**R ecosystem**. Internally, midfieldr and midfielddata use a data.table syntax and structure. Thus data frames returned by midfieldr functions and the practice data sets are of class "data.table." In general the midfieldr vignettes use the following packages: 

- midfieldr 
- midfielddata 
- data.table [@Dowle+Srinivasan:2020:data.table]
- ggplot2 [@Wickham:2016:ggplot2]
 
For users preferring the dplyr "dialect", the midfieldr functions are generally magrittr-pipe friendly, but class "tibble" data frames are converted to class "data.table" (both of which are class "data.frame".)

**Testing**. If a midfieldr user encounters a bug, they can check if the package unit tests run successfully on their system by installing the tinytest package [@van_der_Loo:2020:tinytest] and running, 

```r
tinytest::test_package("midfieldr")
```

The results of that test can be helpful to the midfieldr maintainers when responding to bug reports.
