The goal of midfieldr is to provide tools and guides for working with longitudinal data from the MIDFIELD database.  




## Overview 

[**MIDFIELD**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD){target="_blank"} contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7M students at 21 US institutions (as of June 2022). MIDFIELD is large enough to permit grouping and summarizing by multiple characteristics, enabling researchers to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, prior achievement) and curricular pathways (including coursework and major) by institution and over time. 

**midfieldr** is an R package that provides tools for working with MIDFIELD SURs. The tools in midfieldr work with the research data in the MIDFIELD database and with the practice data in the midfielddata package.  

[**midfielddata**](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/){target="_blank"} is an R package that provides practice data (a proportionate stratified sample of  MIDFIELD) with longitudinal SURs for nearly 98,000 undergraduates at 12 institutions from 1987–2016 organized in four data tables: 

<small>
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(wrapr::build_frame(
  "Practice data table", "Each row is", "No. of rows", "No. of columns" |
    "[`student`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/student.html)", "a student upon admission as degree-seeking", "97,640", "13" |
    "[`course`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/course.html)", "a student in a course", "3.5M", "12" |
    "[`term`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/term.html)", "a student in a term", "728,000", "13" |
    "[`degree`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/degree.html)", "a student upon completion of their program", "48,000", "5"
), align = "llrr")
```
</small>

All four data tables are keyed by student ID. Tables `student` and `degree` have one observation (row) per student. Tables `course` and `term` have multiple observations per student because students can be enrolled in more than one course in a term and more than one term over their program. 




## Usage

In a typical workflow, we filter (subset by row) student unit records to retain desired observations, assign classifications such as program, sex, or race/ethnicity, select variables (subset by column), group and summarize, and display the results in graphs or tables. 

Additional filtering is performed as needed at any point in the process. In outline, the steps are: 

- filter
- classify 
- count
- display 



In this brief usage example, we compare counts of engineering students by race/ethnicity, sex, and graduation status. Data manipulation is performed using data.table syntax. 

```{r}
# Packages used
library("midfieldr")
library("midfielddata")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("data.table"))

# Load the midfielddata practice data
data(student, term, degree)

# Initialize the working data table
DT <- copy(term)
```

**Filter.** We use "filter" to mean subsetting by rows to retain observations with desired characteristics. In this example, we retain observations for which: 1) the span of terms in the data are sufficient for assessing program completion; 2) students are degree-seeking; and 3) students are enrolled in the programs of interest and in this example keeping the first instance only . 

```{r}
# Subset observations for data sufficiency
DT <- add_timely_term(DT, midfield_term = term)
DT <- add_data_sufficiency(DT, midfield_term = term)
DT <- DT[data_sufficiency == TRUE]

# Subset observations for degree-seeking
DT <- filter_match(DT, match_to = student, by_col = "mcid")

# Subset observations for programs
DT <- DT[cip6 %like% "^14"]

# Subset observations for unique students (first instance) 
DT <- DT[, .SD[1], by = c("mcid")]
```

**Classify.** Obtain 1) the students' graduation status; and 2) student sex and race/ethnicity. 

```{r}
# Determine graduation status
DT <- add_completion_timely(DT, midfield_degree = degree)
DT[, grad_status := fifelse(completion_timely, "grad", "non-grad")]

# Obtain sex and race/ethnicity
DT <- add_race_sex(DT, midfield_student = student)
```

**Filter.** Assume that the study design excludes students with race/ethnicity of "International" and "Other/Unknown". Now that the race/ethnicity classification has been added, we can apply this filter. 

```{r}
# Filter for specific race/ethnicity data  
rows_we_want <- !DT$race %chin% c("International", "Other/Unknown")
DT <- DT[rows_we_want]
```

**Count.** Group and summarize by desired variables.  

```{r}
# Count by the grouping variables
grouping_variables <- c("grad_status", "sex", "race")
DT <- DT[, .N, by = grouping_variables]
```

**Display.** We use conventional data.table syntax for creating a readable table. For charts like those shown in the vignettes, we use the ggplot2 package.   

```{r}
# Combine two columns to create a wide table
DT[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]
DT_display <- dcast(DT, race_sex ~ grad_status, value.var = "N")
DT_display[]
```

## Install midfieldr {#install-midfieldr}

midfieldr is not yet available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). To install the development version of midfieldr from its `drat` repository, type in the Console: 

``` r
# install midfieldr from drat repo
install.packages("midfieldr", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
```

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
library("midfieldr")
help("midfieldr-package")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-1.png")
```






## Install midfielddata {#install-midfielddata}

Because of its size, installing the practice data takes time; please be patient and wait for the prompt “>” to reappear. In the Console, run:

``` r
# install midfielddata  
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
# be patient
``` 

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
