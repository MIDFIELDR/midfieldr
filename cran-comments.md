# Purpose

Fourth re-submission to fix problems. 

* Added \\donttest{} to the examples in the function filter_cip() to address the incoming automated check results that stated the example CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time. 
* Two NOTES refer to a 24Mb data package named "midfielddata". I could be mistaken, but I thought it was acceptable to use "Suggests" to identify the package and "Additional_repositories" to identify its GitHub-hosted 'drat' repository. If I have managed this incorrectly, I welcome your suggestions. 

Again, my regards and thanks for your time and patience.
