\details{
The \code{keep_any} argument is an atomic character vector of search terms  used to filter the CIP data frame. Typical search terms include words and phrases describing academic programs or their CIP codes.

Several collections of named series are provided to facilitate searching for groups of programs such as Biological Sciences, Engineering, Physical Sciences, etc. For the named series help page, run \code{? cip_series}.

The function returns a subset of \code{data}. All columns are retained.
