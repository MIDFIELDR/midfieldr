Description: The goal of midfieldr is to provide tools for working with 
    MIDFIELD data, a resource for research on undergraduate students' 
    trajectories through the university that includes longitudinal, 
    de-identified, whole population data for multiple US institutions. 
    A proportionate stratified sample of MIDFIELD data are available in 
    midfielddata, an R data package with longitudinal student unit-records 
    (SUR) for 98,000 undergraduates at 12 institutions from 1987--2016. To 
    access midfielddata, run 'install.packages("midfielddata", 
    repos="https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", type="source")'. The tools 
    in midfieldr work equally well with the practice data in midfielddata 
    and the research data in MIDFIELD. This work is supported by a grant 
    from the US National Science Foundation (EEC 1545667).
