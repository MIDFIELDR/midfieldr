Description: Provides tools for working with registrar's data from MIDFIELD, a 
    database containing (as of October, 2022) Student Unit Records (SURs) for 
    1.7M undergraduate students at 19 US institutions. Access to the MIDFIELD 
    research database is currently limited to its partner institutions, but a 
    sample of the data is available in the 'R' data package ‘midfielddata’, 
    providing practice data and documentation of anonymized SURs for 
    approximately 98,000 students at three US institutions from 1988 through 
    2018. The tools in 'midfieldr' are designed to work with both the MIDFIELD 
    research data and the 'midfielddata' practice data. This work is supported 
    by a grant from the US National Science Foundation (EEC 1545667).
