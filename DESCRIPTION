Description: Tools for investigating a stratified sample of the MIDFIELD 
  database, compiled from registrars' student records from participating US 
  universities. The sample contains data for every course taken and degrees 
  earned by 98,000 undergraduate students from 1987 to 2016.  Interacts with 
  midfielddata, a 31 MB data package available in a 'drat' repository. To access 
  this data package, run 'install.packages("midfielddata", repos = 
  "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", type = "source")'. This work is 
  supported by a grant from the US National Science Foundation (EEC 1545667).
