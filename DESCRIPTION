Title: Tools and Methods for Working with MIDFIELD Data in 'R'
Version: 1.0.1
Description: Provides tools and demonstrates methods for working with individual 
  undergraduate student-level records (registrar's data) in 'R'. Tools include 
  filters for program codes, data sufficiency, and timely completion. Methods 
  include gathering blocs of records, computing quantitative metrics such as 
  graduation rate, and creating charts to visualize comparisons. 'midfieldr'  
  interacts with data provided in 'midfielddata', a data package with an 
  installed size of about 24 Mb available via a 'drat' repository at  
  <https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/>. Funding for this work provided 
  in part by the US National Science Foundation (1545667 and 2142087).
