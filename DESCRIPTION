Description: Tools for investigating a stratified sample from the MIDFIELD 
  database, a dataset compiled from registrar's student records from 
  participating US universities. The sample contains data for every course taken 
  and degrees earned by 98,000 undergraduate students from 1987 to 2016. This 
  package interacts with data available through the 'midfielddata' package, 
  which is available in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package, run 
  'install.packages("midfielddata", repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", type = "source")'. 
  The size of the 'midfielddata' package is approximately 31 Mb. This work is  
  supported by a grant from the US National Science Foundation (EEC 1545667).
