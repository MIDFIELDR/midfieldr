MIDFIELD is the acronym for the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD" target="blank">(link)</a>. 

Longitudinal studies using MIDFIELD are not limited to Engineering---the database includes *all* student records from member institutions.
