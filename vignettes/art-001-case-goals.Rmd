Part 1 of a case study in three parts, illustrating how we work with longitudinal student-level records.  

1. *Goals.* &nbsp; Introducing the study.   

2. *Data.* &nbsp; Transforming the data to yield the observations of interest.

3. *Results.* &nbsp; Summary statistics, metric, chart, and table.

: $$
  \small S = \frac{N_g}{N_e} = \frac{\mathrm{number\ of\ graduates\ of\ a\ program}}{\mathrm{number\ ever\ enrolled\ in\ the\ program}}
  $$

: Stickiness is a more-inclusive alternative to graduation rate as a measure of a program's success in attracting, keeping, and graduating their undergraduates. Stickiness includes many students excluded by graduation rate such as part-time students, transfers, students admitted in any term, and migrators [@Ohland+Orr+others:2012]. 

 




## Goals

Task

: Compute and compare the stickiness of Civil, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical Engineering programs with students grouped by race/ethnicity and sex. 

Purpose

: The case study illustrates how we work with student-level data. Starting with the curated data and concluding with a chart of the metric, we focus throughout on our process and the underlying rationale. 

Constraint

: While we provide all the necessary code, we limit our discussion of the code (functions, arguments, syntax, etc.) to meet the constraint of providing a brief, yet complete, case study. Such discussions are left to later articles. One can always use the R help system to read more about a data set or function.
