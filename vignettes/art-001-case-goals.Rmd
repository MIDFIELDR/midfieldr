Part 1 of a case study in three parts, illustrating how we work with longitudinal Student Unit Records (SUR). 

1. Goals (this page). Introducing the study.   

2. [Data.](art-002-case-data.html) Transforming the data to yield the observations of interest.

3. [Results.](art-003-case-results.html) Calculating summary statistics and metrics and displaying the results. 






## Definitions

student unit records (SUR)

: Registrarâ€™s student-level data compiled by an institution and anonymized and curated by the MIDFIELD data steward. SURs include personal information (e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity), enrollment information (e.g., institution, program, and grade level), and academic information (e.g., courses, grades, and degrees). MIDFIELD data are organized into four tables---student, course, term, and degree---keyed by student ID.

program stickiness

: The ratio $(S)$ of the number of students graduating from a program $(N_g)$ to the number of students ever enrolled in the program $(N_e)$.
$$
S=\frac{N_g}{N_e}
$$
: Stickiness is a more-inclusive alternative to graduation rate as a measure of of a program's success in attracting, keeping, and graduating their undergraduates. All students excluded by the conventional definition of graduation rate are included in the stickiness metric: part-time, transfers, admitted in any term, and migrators [@Ohland+Orr+others:2012]. 

 




## Goals

The technical goal of the case study is to compare the program stickiness of Civil, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical Engineering programs with students grouped by race/ethnicity and sex. 

The meta-goal of the case study is to illustrate a typical procedure for working with SUR data. 






## What the case study does

- We focus on our procedures and underlying rationale for working with SURs. 

- For reproducibility, we provide all the necessary code. 

- We use the [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/)  package instead of base R or the dplyr package for speed, memory efficiency, and concise transforms via the []-indexing operator.

- We use the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package instead of base R or lattice (or other R packages) because: ggplot2's layered approach allows  plots to evolve (or devolve) with minimal changes to code; easily-invoked facets and legends simplify multivariate exploration; and its popularity yields extensive online help. 









## What the case study does not do


- For brevity in the case study, we do not explain the details of midfieldr syntax, functions, or arguments. Those details are covered in other  [vignettes](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/). 

- We do not explain data.table or ggplot2 syntax except for selected functions. Such details are available in numerous online resources including the [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) home pages.
