Stickiness is a more-inclusive alternative to graduation rate as a measure of a program's success in attracting, keeping, and graduating their undergraduates. All students excluded by a conventional graduation rate metric--including migrators---are included in the stickiness metric [@Ohland+Orr+others:2012].

## A more inclusive metric 

Stickiness, in comparison to [graduation rate](art-100-grad-rate.html), has these characteristics:

- Includes migrators, where graduation rate does not. 

- Is based on the bloc of ever enrolled rather than starters, so there is no need for [FYE proxies](art-060-fye-proxies.html).

- Counts all graduates (timely completers) in a program, eliminating the need to filter graduates based on their starting program. 

- Like the MIDFIELD definition of graduation rate (in contrast to the IPEDS definition), includes students who attend college part-time, who transfer between institutions, and who start in any term. 

As they pertain to the stickiness metric, relationships among starters, migrators, and graduates (timely completers) of a given program *P* are illustrated in Figure 1. 

- The interior rectangle represents the stickiness numerator $(N_g)$, the set of graduates (timely completers) of program *P*.   

- The overall rectangle represents the stickiness denominator $(N_e)$, the set of students ever enrolled in program *P*.

## Method

Demonstrating the following elements of a MIDFIELD workflow.  

1. *Planning.*  &nbsp; The metric is stickiness. Required blocs are ever-enrolled and graduates. Grouping variables are program, race/ethnicity, and sex. Programs are the four Engineering programs used throughout. 

1. *Initial processing.* &nbsp; Filter the student-level records for data sufficiency and degree-seeking.

1. *Blocs.* &nbsp; Gather ever enrolled, filter by program. Gather graduates, filter by program. 

1. *Groupings.* &nbsp; Add grouping variables. 

1. *Metrics* &nbsp; Summarize by grouping variables and compute stickiness.  

1. *Displays* &nbsp; Create multiway chart and results table.

## Load data

*Start.* &nbsp; If you are writing your own script to follow along, we use these packages in this article:

```{r}
library(midfieldr)
library(midfielddata)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

*Load.* &nbsp; Practice datasets. View data dictionaries via `?student`, `?term`, `?degree`.  

```{r}
# Load practice data
data(student, term, degree)
```

*Loads with midfieldr.* &nbsp; Prepared data. View data dictionary via `?study_programs`, `?baseline_mcid`. 

- `study_programs`  (derived in [Programs](art-040-programs.html#assigning-program-names)). 

- `baseline_mcid`  (derived in [Blocs](art-050-blocs.html#initial-processing)).




## Initial processing

*Select (optional).* &nbsp; Reduce the number of columns. Code reproduced from [Getting started](art-000-getting-started.html#reusable-code). 

```{r}
# Optional. Copy of source files with all variables
source_student <- copy(student)
source_term <- copy(term)
source_degree <- copy(degree)

# Optional. Select variables required by midfieldr functions
student <- select_required(source_student)
term <- select_required(source_term)
degree <- select_required(source_degree)
```

```{r child = "../man/rmd/note-baseline-mcid.Rmd"}
```

```{r}
# Working data frame
DT <- copy(baseline_mcid)
```




## Ever enrolled 

*Ever enrolled.* &nbsp; The summary code chunk from [Blocs](art-050-blocs.html#reusable-code-blocs). 

```{r}
# Ever-enrolled bloc
DT <- term[DT, .(mcid, cip6), on = c("mcid")]
DT <- unique(DT)

# Filter by program
DT <- study_programs[DT, on = c("cip6"), nomatch = NULL]
DT[, cip6 := NULL]
DT <- unique(DT)
DT
```

*Copy.* &nbsp; To prepare for joining with graduates. 

```{r}
# Prepare for joining
setcolorder(DT, c("mcid"))
ever_enrolled <- copy(DT)
ever_enrolled
```







## Graduates

*Initialize.* &nbsp; The data frame of baseline IDs is the intake for this section. 

```{r}
# Working data frame
DT <- copy(baseline_mcid)
```

*Graduates* &nbsp; The summary code chunk from [Graduates](art-080-graduates.html#reusable-code)

```{r}
# Gather graduates and their degree CIPs
DT <- add_timely_term(DT, term)
DT <- add_completion_status(DT, degree)
DT <- DT[completion_status == "timely"]
DT <- degree[DT, .(mcid, term_degree, cip6), on = c("mcid")]

# Filter by program and first-degree terms only
DT <- study_programs[DT, on = c("cip6"), nomatch = NULL]
DT <- DT[, .SD[which.min(term_degree)], by = "mcid"]
DT[, c("cip6", "term_degree") := NULL]
DT <- unique(DT)
DT
```

*Copy.* &nbsp; To prepare for joining with ever enrolled 

```{r}
# Prepare for joining
setcolorder(DT, c("mcid"))
graduates <- copy(DT)
graduates
```









## Groupings

One of our grouping variables (`program`) is already included in the data frames. The next grouping variable is `bloc` to distinguish starters from graduates when the two data frames are combined.

*Add a variable.* &nbsp; Label ever enrolled and graduates. 

```{r}
# For grouping by bloc
ever_enrolled[, bloc := "ever_enrolled"]
graduates[, bloc := "graduates"]
```

*Join.* &nbsp; Combine the two blocs to prepare for summarizing. A graduate has two observations in these data: one as ever enrolled and one as a graduate. 

```{r}
# Prepare for summarizing
DT <- rbindlist(list(ever_enrolled, graduates))
DT
```

*Add variables.* &nbsp; Demographics from [Groupings](art-090-groupings.html#reusable-code)

```{r}
# Join race/ethnicity and sex
cols_we_want <- student[, .(mcid, race, sex)]
DT <- cols_we_want[DT, on = c("mcid")]
DT
```

MIDFIELD research findings are regularly grouped by program, race/ethnicity, and sex, as illustrated here. However, applied to the practice data these groupings produce several groups with totals below the threshold we impose to preserve anonymity, introducing a number of NA values in the resulting charts and tables. These NAs are largely an artifact of applying these groupings to practice data.

*Verify prepared data.* &nbsp; `study_observations`, included with midfieldr, contains the case study information developed above. Here we verify that the two data frames have the same content. 

```{r}
# Demonstrate equivalence
same_content(DT, study_observations)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

# Run manually
# Writing external files
setkey(DT, mcid)
setkey(DT, NULL)
study_observations <- copy(DT)
usethis::use_data(study_observations, overwrite = TRUE)
```





## Stickiness

*Summarize.* &nbsp; Count the numbers of observations for each combination of the grouping variables. 

```{r}
# Count observations by group
grouping_variables <- c("bloc", "program", "sex", "race")
DT <- DT[, .N, by = grouping_variables]
setorderv(DT, grouping_variables)
DT
```

*Reshape.* &nbsp; Transform to row-record form to set up the stickiness metric  calculation. Transform the *N* column into two columns, one for ever-enrolled  and one for graduates. 

```{r}
# Prepare to compute metric
DT <- dcast(DT, program + sex + race ~ bloc, value.var = "N", fill = 0)
DT
```

*Create a variable.*  &nbsp; Compute the metric. 

```{r}
# Compute metric
DT[, stickiness := round(100 * graduates / ever_enrolled, 1)]
DT
```

*Verify prepared data.* &nbsp; `study_results`, included with midfieldr, contains the case study information developed above. Here we verify that the two data frames have the same content. 

```{r}
# Demonstrate equivalence
same_content(DT, study_results)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

# Run manually
# Writing external files
setkey(DT, program, sex, race)
setkey(DT, NULL)
study_results <- copy(DT)
usethis::use_data(study_results, overwrite = TRUE)
```








## Prepare for dissemination

*Filter.* &nbsp; To preserve the anonymity of the people involved, we remove observations with fewer than `N_threshold` graduates. With the research data, we typically set this threshold to 10; with the practice data, we demonstrate the procedure using a threshold of 5. 

```{r}
# Preserve anonymity
N_threshold <- 5 # 10 for research data
DT <- DT[graduates >= N_threshold]
DT
```

*Recode.* &nbsp;  Readers can more readily interpret our charts and tables if the programs are unabbreviated.

```{r}
# Recode values for chart and table readability
DT[, program := fcase(
  program %like% "CE", "Civil",
  program %like% "EE", "Electrical",
  program %like% "ME", "Mechanical",
  program %like% "ISE", "Industrial/Systems"
)]
DT
```

*Add a variable.* &nbsp; We combine race/ethnicity and sex to create a combined grouping variable. 

```{r}
# Create a combined category
DT[, people := paste(race, sex)]
DT[, `:=`(race = NULL, sex = NULL)]
setcolorder(DT, c("program", "people"))
DT
```



## Chart

*Order factors.* &nbsp; Order the levels of the categories. Code adapted from [Multiway data and charts](art-120-multiway.html#percentage-ordered-data). 

```{r}
# Order the categories
DT <- order_multiway(DT,
  quantity   = "stickiness",
  categories = c("program", "people"),
  method     = "percent",
  ratio_of   = c("graduates", "ever_enrolled")
)
DT
```


*Multiway chart.* &nbsp; Code adapted from [Multiway data and charts](art-120-multiway.html#percentage-ordered-charts). 

The vertical reference line is the aggregate stickiness of the program, independent of race/ethnicity and sex. A missing data marker or missing group indicates the number of graduates was below the threshold set to preserve anonymity---largely an artifact of applying these groupings to practice data.

```{r fig2}
#| fig-asp: 1.1
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2: Stickiness of four Engineering majors."

ggplot(DT, aes(x = stickiness, y = people)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(program), ncol = 1, as.table = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = program_stickiness), linetype = 2, linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Stickiness (%)", y = "") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(20, 90))
```








## Table

*Results table.* &nbsp; Code adapted from [Multiway data and charts](art-120-multiway.html#tabulating-counts).

```{r}
# Select variables and remove factors
display_table <- copy(DT)
display_table <- display_table[, .(program, people, stickiness)]
display_table[, people := as.character(people)]
display_table[, program := as.character(program)]

# Construct table
display_table <- dcast(display_table, people ~ program, value.var = "stickiness")
setnames(display_table,
  old = c("people"),
  new = c("People"),
  skip_absent = TRUE
)
display_table
```

(Optional) Format the table nearer to publication quality. Here I use kableExtra package. 

```{r}
display_table |>
  kableExtra::kbl(align = "lrrrr", caption = "Table 1: Stickiness (%) of four Engineering majors.") |>
  kableExtra::kable_paper(lightable_options = "basic", full_width = TRUE) |>
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "#c7eae5") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(1:5, color = "black", background = "white")
```

A value of NA indicates a group removed because the number of graduates was below the threshold set to preserve anonymity. As noted earlier, these are largely an artifact of applying these groupings to practice data.
